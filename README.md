>"I think this is the start of something big. Sometimes that hardest step is the first one, and we have just taken it." - Steve Jobs

That is the way that I feel about my pursuit of a change in career. That first step was difficult in the Fall of 2021. After nearly 20 yrs in a job where I had been peaked for years, I decided it was time for me to take the talents I am blessed with, and pursue more personally satisfying and professionally advantageous career opportunities. Now, after taking some time to pursue personal projects and personal development, I am pursuing an old hobby with the intent of turning it into a career. I am excited to see what new opportunities I can find!

There is a world of opportunity out there for those bold enough to reach for it, and it starts with that difficult first step. I have taken my bold first step, and it is the start of something big.
